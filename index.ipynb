    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson provides an introduction to the concept of *similarity* or *distance* measures which is used heavily in data science domain for a number of applications. The lesson will give you an intuitive description for calculating Euclidean distance as a similarity measure, as well as it's implementation in python.\n",

    "#### Similarity is the measure to identify how alike two data objects are. Dis-similarity, on the other hand could be thought of as a measure of how two data objects differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarity measures are used in a number of supervised/un-supervised machine learning tasks e.g. unsupervised clustering and classification algorithms are based on calculating the similarity between given data points. If our dataset is numeric and can be shown in an n-dimensional space, then there are various geometric metrics we can use to collectively process the data elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "> An n-dimensional space can be thought of as a multidimensional scatter plot that can be used to plot n number of dimensions of data (as compared to two/three dimensional scatter plots that we normally see).\n",
    "\n",
    "A 3D scatter plot may look like the example below showing data dimensions with respect to mileage, power and fuel consumption. We can not view data beyond 3 dimensions, however we can process such data numerically as we shall see. \n",

    "### Similarity measures in data mining\n",
    "\n",
    "Data mining often deals with identifying relationships between data objects. Similarity measures in the data mining domain are used to represent a distance, with data dimensions as features of the objects. Small and large values of these distance measures are seen as an indication of high and low similarity respectively. Similarity is a relative measure and depends highly on the domain and application. For example, two cars can be similar because of their color, engine size or price. Hence we need to be very careful when calculating distance across features that are unrelated. Normalized Similarity is usually measured as a value between 0 and 1 (inclusive), where 1 represents a high similarity (X=Y) and 0 - no similarity at all (X$\\neq$Y).  "

    "When measuring the distance between data objects in the plane, we we tend to use the Euclidean distance.It is the most commonly-used of our distance measures and hence often just referred to as “distance”. When data is dense or continuous, this is the best proximity measure. The Euclidean distance between two points is the length of the path connecting them. This measure is based mainly on the Pythagorean theorem as shown in the diagram below:\n",

This is broken down into its components of base and perpendicular. The distance $d$ between these points, following Pythagoras theorem can be simply calculated as: \n",
